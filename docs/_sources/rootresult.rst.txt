Root Viewing
============

Once found the roots are returned in the form of a RootResult object.

.. autoclass:: cxroots.RootResult.RootResult
	:members:

The roots and multiplcities can also be printed in a pretty table:

.. literalinclude:: docex_rootresult.py

.. program-output:: python3 docex_rootresult.py
