	Find an approximation to a point xf such that f(xf)=0 for a

	Parameters
	----------
	x0 : float or complex
		Initial point for Newton iteration, should be as close as
		possible to a root of f
	f : function
		Function of a single variable f(x)
	df : function
		Function of a single variable, df(x), providing the
		derivative of the function f(x) at the point x
	steptol: float, optional
		Routine will end if the step size, dx, between sucessive
		iterations of x satisfies abs(dx) < steptol
	maxIter : int, optional
		Routine ends after maxIter iterations
	callback : function, optional
		After each iteration the supplied function
