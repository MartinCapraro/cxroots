cxroots: rootfinding for complex analytic functions
===================================================

cxroots is a Python library for finding all the roots of a complex analytic function of a single complex variable within a given contour in the complex plane. 
The implementation is based on [1] and the mathematics of this is discussed in greater detail in :ref:`Theory`
