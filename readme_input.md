# cxroots
A Python module to compute all the (simple) roots of an analytic function within a given contour.

---

## Introduction

Given a contour $C$ in the complex plane and a function $f(z)$ (and optionally it's derivative $f'(z)$) which:

* Has no roots or poles on $C$
* Is analytic in the interior of $C$
* Has only simple roots in the interior of $C$

the module is able to compute all the roots of within $C$.


```python
from cxroots import Rectangle, showRoots, findRoots, demo_findRoots
from numpy import sin, cos

rect = Rectangle([-1.5,1.5],[-2,2])
f  = lambda z: z**10 - 2*z**5 + sin(z)*cos(z/2)
showRoots(rect, f)
```

The implementation is primarily based on [1] where the number of roots within a contour, $N$, is calculated by numerical integration of the Cauchy integral,

$$
N=\frac{1}{2i\pi}\oint_C\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz.
$$

The original contour is subdivided until each sub-contour only contains a single root and then the Newton-Raphson method is repeatedly used with random startpoints until the root within each sub-contour is found.

If $f'(z)$ is not provided by the user then it is approximated with a Taylor expansion as in [2].

### Future improvements:
* Allow for multiplicities of roots within $C$.  Perhaps using the method of formal orthogonal polynomials suggested in [3]
* Approximate the roots of $f$ within a contour as the zeros of a constructed polynomial [2]
* If $f'(z)$ is not provided then use the approximation to $f'(z)$ in the Newton-Raphson method

### Installation
Can be downloaded from GitHub and installed by running the included 'setup.py' with
```bash
python setup.py install
```

### Documentation
