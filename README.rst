=======

A Python module to compute all the (simple) zeros of an analytic
function within a given contour.

--------------

Introduction
------------

Given a contour :math:`C` in the complex plane and a function
:math:`f(z)` (and optionally it's derivative :math:`f'(z)`) which:

-  Has no roots or poles on :math:`C`
-  Is analytic in the interior of :math:`C`
-  Has only simple roots in the interior of :math:`C`

the module is able to compute all the roots of within :math:`C`.

.. code:: python

    from cxroots import Rectangle, showRoots, findRoots, demo_findRoots
    from numpy import sin, cos
    
    rect = Rectangle([-1.5,1.5],[-2,2])
    f  = lambda z: z**10 - 2*z**5 + sin(z)*cos(z/2)
    df = lambda z: 10*(z**9 - z**4) + cos(z)*cos(z/2) - 0.5*sin(z)*sin(z/2)
    showRoots(rect, f, df)

The implementation is primarily based on [1] where the number of roots
within a contour, :math:`N_C`, is calculated by numerical integration of
the Cauchy integral,

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{equation}
   N = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}.
   \end{equation}

The original contour is subdivided until each sub-contour only contains
a single root and then the Newton-Raphson method is repeatedly used with
random startpoints until the root within each sub-contour is found.

If :math:`f'(z)` is not provided by the user then it is approximated
with a Taylor expansion as in [2].

.. code:: python

    findRoots(rect, f)

Future improvements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Allow for multiplicities of roots within :math:`C`. Perhaps using the
   method of formal orthogonal polynomials suggested in [3]
-  Approximate the roots of :math:`f` within a contour as the zeros of a
   constructed polynomial [2]
-  If :math:`f'(z)` is not provided then use the approximation to
   :math:`f'(z)` in the Newton-Raphson method

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Can be downloaded from GitHub and installed by running the included
'setup.py' with

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py install
